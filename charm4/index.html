<div class="letter-content">Dear Lotta,

I am <em>so</em> proud of you.

Just a few days ago you turned 17 (what a beautiful number) and then tomorrow you are going to graduate!!

I know. Its scary, graduating high school, moving across the world. Taking a gap year!

But the reality is, you are one of the most hardworking, intelligent, humble, gracious people that I have ever met.

You inspire me.

You inspire me to work harder, to be kinder, to give to others, to have grace, and build myself up in so many ways.

But I dont want to sit here and giggle, pretending that the rest of our lives will be perfect and everything will go as planned. There will be moments where you will wonder wtf happened, there will be moments that we get angry or upset, or feel lonely. There will be times that you feel stressed or overwhelmed, and sometimes this might seep into a blame for yourself.

Often times our mind narrows in on the present, and when you go through these negative parts of life you might temporarily forget all the joy you had in moments like these. Sometimes your mind will make you feel like you aren't enough in certain moments, when in reality you've done way harder things in the past, and climbed way higher mountains, and made so much progress, but your mind keeps looking up, not looking down to realize how high you've climbed, so it tricks you into thinking you're still at the bottom.

I won't always be sitting right next to you like I am right now. Sometimes, I wont be in person to comfort you.

That is why I made this bracelet.

It is a physical reminder, something attached to you, so that every time you look down physically, your mind remembers to look down and realize how far you have come, and remembers the challenges you have overcome in the past, so that you know that whatever challenge that you are currently up against, it can most definitely be climbed and overcome.

Society forces us to look up, always looking for more, or to make a situation better. But I say look down, look down at your hands, and see your bracelet, remembering every win you have ever had, every failure that you thought at the time would hurt you, but that truly didn't matter. Look down and remember when you used to hate bugs and the dark, and now look at you, braver than your boyfriend!!!!!!! Look down and remember when you used to not want to speak english, and now you make my heart melt everyday with the words you speak. Look down and remember when we temporarily broke up, and how we were able to overcome that together.

Even when life will make you feel alone, even when you will feel negative or hate, I will always be here, and my hope is that this bracelet will be a constant reminder of these things.

Something that you can feel, something that you can see, and so that you always remember:

I love you.

I love you no matter how far away from me you are.

I love you no matter how long ago it was that I last saw you or talked to you.

I love you even when either of us will inevitably get mad at the other.

I love you even when you doubt yourself.

I love you even when you think poorly of your own body.

I love you so much lotta.

Life won't always be full of roses, but I sure as heck will be here to keep handing you them.

<span style="display: block; text-align: right;">I love you always and forever,</span>
