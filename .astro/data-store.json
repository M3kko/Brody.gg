Most importantly take their sport (to know which injuries / muscles are most commonly used and usually weaker) and take their goals. \n\nAt first it makes very small changes to a default training plan. Changing the set or rep amounts based off your recovery. But after 7 days from you logging muscle soreness it begins to get an idea of what muscle groups need more work. By day 28, it has created a baseline for you, and models workouts based off that scored baseline, meaning it can completely modify training plans/workouts to what is going to benefit you most. \n\n### Here is a video of me presenting it: \n\n\n## PeakFit Now\nToward the end of August I was given an opportunity to bring my app to another startup that was more focused on the hardware side of things. I ultimately decided to forgo my launch of PeakFit to take this opportunity as I believed this would give me much more experience in startups than if I had stayed on my own (which proved to be true).
