Most importantly take their sport (to know which injuries / muscles are most commonly used and usually weaker) and take their goals. \n\nAt first it makes very small changes to a default training plan. Changing the set or rep amounts based off your recovery. But after 7 days from you logging muscle soreness it begins to get an idea of what muscle groups need more work.
