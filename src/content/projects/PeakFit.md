## The idea
This was my capstone project, as well as my activate project for TKS. I originally got the idea while taking a bath after a 13hr training camp: "Why do we have so much biometric data availble to us, but nothing to influence how we actually train?". Wearables give users a recovery score, which is helpful, but a lot of people think "well what the hell do I do with this" or "thats nice" and close their phone, forgetting about it until the next morning. But as with most ideas I wrote it down and moved on from it. 

But then 3 of my frineds all got injured within weeks of each other. Out for months, all the same type of injury... overuse. Suddenly I remembered my idea, and I realized it could actually be extremely useful for coaches or athletes to influence their training via the technology they already use (smart watches/rings). 

## How it works
Take biometric data + user reported muscle soreness + the basics like their height, weight, weekly training time. Most importantly take their sport (to know which injuries / muscles are most commonly used and usually weaker) and take their goals. 

At first it makes very small changes to a default training plan. Changing the set or rep amounts based off your recovery. But after 7 days from you logging muscle soreness it begins to get an idea of what muscle groups need more work. By day 28, it has created a baseline for you, and models workouts based off that scored baseline, meaning it can completely modify training plans/workouts to what is going to benefit you most.

## PeakFit Now
Toward the end of August I was given an opportunity to bring my app to another startup that was more focused on the hardware side of things. I ultimately decided to forgo my launch of PeakFit to take this opportunity as I believed this would give me much more experience in startups than if I had stayed on my own (which proved to be true). If you're interested in seeing what the app has become now, I'll be making a post on the new NoLimit app sometime soon in the future.
