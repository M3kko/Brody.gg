# I dont even know what cities my top collges are in
While trying to choose between different colleges to prioritize in learning more about, or really just prioritize in my own personal ranking I developed a framework to do so. Ever since I was a little kid I idolized ivy league colleges and all that they had to offer. Except... I didn't really know what they actually offered, and when I realized I did not in fact know much about these colleges I began to wonder why the heck I thought so well of them. Heck I didn't even know what state or city some of these colleges were in, and when I looked them up their campus buildings looked so depressing I got sick at the very idea of spending 4 years there. 

I realized that maybe college isn't all about USnews rankings. Which it isn't because the internet has literally made any professor accessible and the content within those courses able to be found or learned on ones own. So instead I created a list of attributes, and ranked the attributes, then I ranked colleges that aligned most with the attributes I sought. 

# Architecture is cool too
For me that was the school architecture, the labs, and the entrepreneurship programs. Will I be inspired when I walk into the library every single day? Will I gain access to something that I previously could not access whatsoever? Will I be surrounded by likeminded people who want to make an impact via entrepreneurship?
