# POV: You Suck At Chinese Tones
Yeah thats me. Or at least it was. I was having such a hard time learning tones, but then my teacher did a cool game with me. Where she would play a tone, and I had to guess which one it was. Instanlty I had an idea to just make that into a practice app, and so I did. 

Right after class I spent an hour making it and boom I had my practice app, and then I would just pull it up throughout the day to practice hearing the tones and then repeating them myself so I would get better at my pronunciation. I then posted it on Reddit and peopled loved it! So I decided to keep working on it. 

### Up Next: Radicals. 
The next thing I have started to learn is radicals and yes there are sites where you can read the radicals or I could create flash cards. Or I could just create another section on the site to practice my radicals hehe 😎

You can try it out for yourself at [polyglot.cafe](https://www.polyglot.cafe/)

# Whats Next?
I'm going to continuously update this project as I add more tools. Soon I want to add sentence practice, probably will use some elevenlabs or maybe the new Qwen3-TTS. I'll also add a way to practice character writing which I think will be really helpful/cool. Also adding accounts to save progress/track your mistakes easier. Then eventually personalized progress.
