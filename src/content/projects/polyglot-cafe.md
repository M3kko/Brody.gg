# Quizlet sucks.
So basically when I was in high school I was the president of our linguistics club. I was and still am a big nerd when it comes to Etymology and languages in general.

As our members explored different languages I would often create basic flashcard decks for them to practice throughout the week. This worked great for romance languages. But then we got to Japanese...

And Quizlet wouldn't allow certain Japanese words for who knows what reason, specifically the romaji versions. In my frustration and refusal to pay for premium on Quizlet or another service, I instead decided to build my own flashcard site.
