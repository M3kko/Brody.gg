### Going against the rules of regular hackathons
Scrapyard Austin was my first ever Hackathon and it definitely will not be my last. The whole point was to create something against traditional hackathon goals. Rather than solving a problem, you were supposed to be scrappy and actually make a problem harder, like trashcans that closed when you tried to put trash in them, or buttons that moved when you tried to click. 

My team decided to make a flappy bird game, but you had to play by moving a tennis ball up and down. (we were gonna make it that you had to bounce the ball but we couldn't get our hands on an IMU so instead opted to make it hand held and use computer vision.)

Shoutout to my teammates [Andrew](https://github.com/AndrewCromar) and [Riley](https://github.com/RileyBautista) for making my first hackathon so amazing and fun :\)
