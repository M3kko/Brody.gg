Billions are poured into Ai each year, over 400 billion in 2025 alone. Venture capital and consumer attention is constantly focused on solving the next software breakthrough, the next thing to give us more control over the digital world. Yet believe it or not, the reason your phone overheats, electric vehicles cost so much, and fusion is constantly “10 years away”, is not in fact a software problem. 

And yet when MIT media lab posts on X a brand new discovery that could potentially enable one of these technologies, it gets under 20 likes. In comparison a chatgpt wrapper called Jasper AI that does copywriting for you raised 125 million at a 1.5 BILLION dollar valuation. 

Real world shattering technology right here folks.

The reason we don't have better materials isn't just as simple as misplaced priorities. Its a lack of trust in the institutions that we expect innovation to come out of. It’s human nature to want to see progress not measured in decades but in years, or even better, months. So to VC’s, a product that can go from 0 to 30m ARR in 18 months seems like a lot better investment than a new material that will take 18 years to develop. 

Even if this material were to generate 1000x the return, the feedback cycle is too long to see it through. You can write a 100 checks to software companies and have a pretty good idea about which ones are gonna work within a couple years. In the current timeline of materials innovation, this same principle is simply not plausibly profitable. 

So that leaves materials innovation to the bureaucratic hellscape that is academia and government institutions. Institutions that draw our brightest minds towards them, like the beauty of an event horizon. But much like event horizons, nothing ever comes out of them. 

Materials research is stuck on an endless road of bureaucracy, and the longer it is on this road, the larger the gap will grow between our technical capabilities, and the physical reality of us implementing them. We can invest in AI all we want but compute power will not build our fusion reactors, or quantum computers, or the suits that will allow us to live comfortably on Mars. 

Materials science is long overdue for its innovation cycle to be shortened. It sounds impossible, its hard to understand. Yet it will happen, because it has been done before. SpaceX revolutionized the space program, Anduril is bringing speed back to the defense industry, and Moderna proved vaccines could be made in months. 

Materials is next. For humanity’s sake, it has to be.
